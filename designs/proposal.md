Executive Summary
Amtar Engineering Consultancy provides a range of specialized services including Engineering Consulting, Supervision, Interiors Design, Landscape, and Fitout. With a large-scale operation involving diverse workflows, your team currently relies on manual processes, employee coordination, and tools like Emails and WhatsApp, leading to inefficiencies, communication gaps, and operational challenges.
I propose a comprehensive, integrated system to centralize all services, automate workflows, and enhance client interactions. This system will include operational management for each service, a robust notification and email system, client approval mechanisms with digital signatures, contract generation and milestone tracking. Additionally, a dedicated website will serve as a public-facing portal for showcasing projects, services, and industry insights.
This solution will improve efficiency, reduce dependency on manual communications, and provide a professional client experience, ultimately supporting business growth.
Proposed System Overview
The system will be a web-based platform built using modern technologies such as Laravel, and MySQL for data storage. It will be hosted on a secure cloud server (e.g., AWS or similar) for scalability and accessibility. Key features include role-based access (e.g., admins, employees, clients) to ensure data security and workflow control.
